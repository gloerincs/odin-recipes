        <li>Egg (to bind the filling)</li>
        <li>Seasonings (such as parsley, salt, pepper)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Assembly:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese (for layering and topping)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Serving:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Leafy greens (for the salad)</li>
        <li>Salad dressing</li>
        <li>Crusty bread (for garlic bread)</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Butter or olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><h3>Make the Meat Sauce</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the ground meat to the pot. Cook, breaking it apart with a spoon, until it is browned all over. Drain off any excess grease.</li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and the bay leaf.</li>
            <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer gently, partially covered, for at least 45 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. 
                Remove the bay leaf before assembling the lasagna.</li>
        </ol>

    <li><h3>Prepare the Cheesy Filling</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>While the sauce simmers, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the cottage cheese, 1 cup of Parmesan cheese, the beaten egg, fresh parsley, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Mix until everything is well combined. Set aside.</li>
        </ol>

    <li><h3>Preheat Oven and Prepare for Assembly</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Ensure your lasagna noodles are cooked and ready for layering.</li>
        </ol>

    <li><h3>Assemble the Lasagna</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread about 1 cup of the meat sauce evenly over the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Arrange a single layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Spread half of the cheesy filling mixture evenly over the noodles.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle about one-third of the shredded mozzarella cheese over the filling.</li>
            <li>Spoon another layer of meat sauce over the mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers: noodles, the remaining cheesy filling, another third of the mozzarella, and more meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Place the final layer of noodles on top. Cover generously with the remaining meat sauce, ensuring all noodles are covered to prevent them from drying out.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and a little extra Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
        </ol>
   
    <li><h3>Bake the Lasagna</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for another 15 minutes, or until the top is bubbly and the cheese is lightly browned.</li>
        </ol>
   
    <li><h3>Rest and Serve</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Carefully remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for at least 10-15 minutes before slicing. This is a crucial step that allows the layers to set, 
                making it much easier to serve clean slices.</li>
            <li>Serve warm with a fresh leafy green salad and hot, crusty garlic bread on the side.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
