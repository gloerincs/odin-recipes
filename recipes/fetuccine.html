    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz (about half a standard box) fettuccine pasta</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into cubes</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (Parmigiano-Reggiano, if possible), plus extra for serving</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper to taste (optional, but highly recommended)</li>
         </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>  
         <ol>
            <li><em>Cook the Pasta:</em> Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the fettuccine and cook according to package directions until al dente (firm to the bite). Reserve about 1 cup of the starchy pasta water before draining the pasta. This pasta water is your secret weapon for a silky sauce!</li>
            <li><em>Melt the Butter:</em> While the pasta is cooking, in a large skillet or wide pan over medium-low heat, melt the cubed butter. Swirl the pan to coat the bottom.</li>
            <li><em>Add the Cream:</em> Pour in the heavy cream and gently warm it through, stirring occasionally. Do not let it boil. You want it to be hot but not simmering vigorously.</li>
            <li><em>Combine & Emulsify:</em> Once the pasta is drained, immediately add the hot fettuccine directly to the skillet with the butter and cream. Using tongs, gently toss the pasta to coat it thoroughly.</li>
            <li><em>Stir in Parmesan:</em> Gradually add the freshly grated Parmesan cheese, a little at a time, continuously tossing the pasta. The cheese will melt into the warm sauce, creating a thick, glossy coating.</li>
            <li><em>Adjust Consistency (with Pasta Water):</em> If the sauce seems too thick or sticky, add a tablespoon or two of the reserved pasta water at a time, tossing constantly, until you reach your desired creamy consistency. The starch in the water helps to emulsify the sauce.</li>
            <li><em>Season & Serve:</em> Season with salt to taste (remember Parmesan is salty, so taste first!). Add a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper if desired. Serve immediately, garnished with extra grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
         </ol>
